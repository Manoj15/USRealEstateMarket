# US Real Estate Market 

The motive of this is to design an end-to-end data pipeline for US Real Estate Market trends and monthly statistics. It sources the data from Realtor.com Real Estate Data Library (https://www.realtor.com/research/data/). It contains scores and rankings based on days on market (supply index) and realtor.com views per property (demand index). Data dictionary is in the same website.

TODO : 
1. Streaming append to the data for monthly refresh.
2. Dashboard in-progress.
3. Data Quality checks before data ingestion and processing

Kudos to realtor.com for the data.
